Installation
============

The are two ways to run the game. One is setting up Ruby in your environment,
along all the necessary libraries. Download the source code and run the game.

The other is to go to this repository's releases page, and download a bundled
version. For now, I only provide a macOS bundle, but I can soon provide a
Windows one as well.

Running or developing on macOS
==============================

1. Install the latest Ruby version
2. `brew install sdl2 libogg libvorbis`
3. `gem install gosu`
4. `gem install chipmunk`

Running or developing on Windows
================================

[...Help Needed...]
Need someone with Windows to contribute this bit. They need to be able to run
this game on their system.
