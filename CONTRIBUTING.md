## What makes a good feature

We may welcome an entirely new level from scratch, but please make sure
have you checked the project's list of issues in case we already have
something in mind.

Also, please make sure the level you are developing fits in the story.

## Bug fixes

Bug fixes are always welcome

## Improve code

Refactoring code is welcome. We don't have tests currently, which makes
it a bit more difficult to test big changes. Small changes may have
better chances to get accepted.
